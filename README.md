## My Home Office Setup

As working from home becomes the "new normal" I've spent some time in making sure I have a comfortable home office set up.

### Desk

The desk is an Ikea GERTON table top with TORSKLINT legs. The Legs ended up being almost as expensive as the worktop. You will need to treat the worktop as it is untreated and unprotected. I used refined beeswax and applied a couple of layers. I'm contemplating protecting it with some kind of protective finish but I'm keen to keep the finish matt.

### Monitors

I have two Dell U2719D displays on a BONTEC Dual Monitor Mount. The mount can be quite tricky to align and it's worth noting that due to the design of the arms it probably won't sit flush to the wall. This is not too much of a problem but if your desk isn't too deep it may cause issues.

Monitors are connected via two DisplayPort connectors to a Dock.

### Dock

The Dock is a Dell D6000 universal dock. I connect via USB-C which also allows me to charge/power my Surface Laptop when using that device. Some laptops don't accept charging via USB-C and the dock isn't powerful enough to charge some more powerful laptops. Probably worth checking your device before you make a decision on the dock.

The dock connects all my accessories and my montiors to the laptop. If I need to switch laptops I simply plug the USB-C connector in to another device. It also has an adapter to run via standard USB-A.

### Webcam

I'm using a logitech StreamCam that connects to the dock via USB-C. Picture quality is great and it means I can look at a bigger screen whilst in video/conference calls.

### Mouse

I got this second hand from CEX as I wasn't sure I wanted to spend so much on a mouse. However it's honestly one of the best mice I've used. Having bluetooth means one less dongle to plus in and I can quickly switch between devices. It feels solid and is nice to use.
